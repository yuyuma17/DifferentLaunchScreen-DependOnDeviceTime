# DifferentLaunchScreen-DependOnDeviceTime
Hi, I'm Lacie, an iOS developer.

This is a project about showing different launch screen depending on your device time.

If you like this project, you can press â˜…Star to follow it.

And if you are good at Chinese, you can see the [article](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10225998) I wrote about the process while doing the project.
